# Toxic Comment Classification using NLP Deep Learning

## Overview

Toxic Comment Classification using NLP Deep Learning is a project that addresses the challenge of identifying toxic comments in text data. Leveraging the power of NLP (Natural Language Processing) and Deep Learning, this project classifies text comments as toxic or non-toxic. The model is built using TensorFlow and utilizes the Toxic Comment Classification Dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset

The project employs the Toxic Comment Classification Dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains a large collection of text comments labeled as toxic or non-toxic. The dataset is thoughtfully divided into training, validation, and test sets to enable supervised learning.

## Model Architecture

For text vectorization and building the deep learning model, TensorFlow is utilized. The model architecture includes layers for processing textual data, followed by dense layers to make predictions. The choice of an appropriate architecture is critical in achieving accurate classification results.

## Gradio Interface

To facilitate user interaction and model predictions, the project incorporates Gradio, a user-friendly interface. Gradio allows users to input text comments and receive real-time predictions on whether the comments are toxic or not. This interface enhances the usability and accessibility of the model.

## Features

- **NLP Deep Learning Model:** The project harnesses NLP and Deep Learning techniques to build a robust model for toxic comment classification.

- **TensorFlow Text Vectorizer:** TensorFlow's Text Vectorizer is employed to preprocess and vectorize the textual data for input to the model.

- **Gradio User Interface:** The integration of Gradio creates a seamless and interactive experience for users to explore the model's predictions.

## How to Use the Project

To use and experience the model's predictions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Download the Toxic Comment Classification Dataset from Kaggle using the provided link.

3. Set up the required dependencies, including TensorFlow, Gradio, and other libraries, as detailed in the project's README file.

4. Run the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

5. After the model is trained, deploy the Gradio interface to interact with the model and test it with custom comments.

## Contribution and Future Improvements

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues, have ideas to improve the model's performance, or wish to expand the functionality, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.

In the future, I plan to explore other NLP techniques, such as using transformer-based models, and implement ensemble methods to further enhance the model's accuracy.

## Acknowledgments
